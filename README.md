# Stock Manager

This project was done as a part of my Bachelor in Computer Science degree from the Staffordshire University, under the module Software Development and Application Modelling. We were required to use Object Oriented Programming concepts and thus have been incorporated as seen fit. 
This project encompasses the following Use Cases: 

 1. Add a new Stock Item.
 2. Add Quantity or Remove Quantity from existing stock item.
 3. View Stock Levels.
 4. Delete a Stock Item.
 5. View Transaction log.

 The script for the database is included in the script folder. The App responds to "admin" as both the username and password at log in. In this project, I have utilized ADO.NET along with the SQL Client library to establish a robust connection with the database.
